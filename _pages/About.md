Hey! Thanks for stopping by :wave:

<br>
I am second year Ph.D. student at [MBZUAI](https://mbzuai.ac.ae), Abu Dhabi, UAE advised by [Prof. Martin Takac](https://mtakac.com) and [Prof. Kun Zhang](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/study/faculty/kun-zhang/). Previously, I completed my M.Sc. in Artificial Intelligence at [Skoltech](https://new.skoltech.ru/en/), Moscow, Russia. I hold a B.Sc. in Robotics.


<br>
I am interested in probabilistic generative modeling, stochastic processses, reinforcement learning and their application in real-world problems such as computer vision :eyes:, drug discovery :dna:, and beyond. Also, I am a big fan of open-source software and try to contribute to the community whenever I can. Specifically, I am helping develop and maintain [OpenCV](https://opencv.org), the world's most popular computer vision library :fire:
